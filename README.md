# Current Project State

- Very Alpha - not really usable!

# tcmj - shampug randoms

The tcmj shampug project is a small but powerful java library to generate random test data. In first place we want to provide registration data (address records). Purpose is to build up test systems like unit and integration tests.

## why not using an existing one?

After researching most libs out there i couldn't get any satisfaction.

## what is your expectations?

- I don't want hundreds of new dependencies to solve this simple problem
- There should be some good default implementations for common use
- I also want to provide extensibility to customize my needs and also add new data
- Data fields should depend on each other to form valid records (postalcode -> city)
- Localization should be supported
- Use a standard if there is one
- Java 8 language specifications

## what about that name?

Its a connection of 'to sham' and my 'pug dogs'. Consider life without pugs makes no sense!

You're very welcome! 
Due to localization needs it would be awesome if there would join people from many different countries.
